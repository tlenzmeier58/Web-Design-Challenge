# Web-Design-Challenge

## The objective of this challenge is to create our own webpage utilizing the work done on a previous assignment.

#### I have created the following pages: landing page, temp, humidity, cloudiness, and wind pages. I have also added a comparison page and a data page. 

### I utilized the bootstrap tool to create an interactive web-page.

### I AM NOT A WEB PAGE DESIGNER NOR DO I EVER, EVER WANT TO BE ONE. I DISLIKE THIS ASSIGNMENT IMMENSELY.
